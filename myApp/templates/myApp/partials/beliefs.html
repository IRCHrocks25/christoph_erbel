        For me, it’s always been important that the people I learn from live what they teach.

          <p>
            I have to confess, I didn’t know what love truly was. I longed for it all my life, but tried to earn it
            by being likable, needed, attractive. What I didn’t realize was that love doesn’t come from others.
            It begins within.
          </p>
          <p>
            The turning point came when I was finally willing to open my heart to myself. To see the whole picture,
            with my wounds, my history, my strength, and my tenderness. And to stay. No more pretending.
            No more pleasing. No more abandoning my Self.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I chose love, real unconditional love, something inside me shifted. False identities fell away.
            I began to feel whole again. Connected. Alive. At peace.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, I know love isn’t just a feeling. It’s a vibration. A decision. Possible in each moment of life.
            A way of being. And it’s the most powerful force I know.

          <p>
            For most of my life, I wasn’t grateful. It never felt like enough. Not success, not love, not recognition.
            I kept searching outside myself, trying to fill the emptiness within. Always striving. Never arriving.
          </p>
          <p>
            Until one day, I stopped. And in that stillness, I saw what had always been there. I already have everything
            I need to live my life — not perfectly, but truthfully. In my own rhythm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since then, gratitude has become my daily beginning. Not just for what I have, but for who I’ve become.
            Not only for the good things, but also for the hard ones. Because every challenge helps me grow beyond who I was.
          </p>
          <p>
            I no longer chase phantoms. What’s truly meant for me will come. No more, but also no less.

      <!-- Forgiveness -->

          <p class="text-xs md:text-sm uppercase tracking-[0.24em] text-slate-500">
            The freedom of letting go
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="max-w-xl space-y-4 text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
          <p>
            We all carry a story. About what happened. About what hurt. And even though we can’t change the past,
            we often end up letting it define us. Without even knowing. Carrying a huge burden.
          </p>
          <p>
            I found my turning point in a quiet decision: to let go. To accept what happened, without blame.
            To see others as they are, carrying their own pain. Just like I did.
          </p>
          <p>
            And something unexpected happened. From that came grace. Feeling free. Grateful. Even for the hard moments,
            because they shaped who I am.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the most radical form of forgiveness? Forgiving myself. For forgetting who I am. For letting others define my truth.
            For turning my pain into guilt and shame for so long.
          </p>
          <p>
            Forgiveness doesn’t mean excusing what happened. It means choosing not to carry it anymore.
            It didn’t change the past. But it changed me. And that changed everything.

            Most of my life, I was focused on the outside. Always three steps ahead, trying to control the future.
            Not to fail. Not to be rejected. But to be seen, appreciated, valued.
          </p>
          <p>
            I never paused long enough to ask: What is really here, right now, inside me?
            Looking back, I realize all that striving was a way to outrun my past, my doubts, my fears,
            my quiet sense of not being enough.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had to learn to slow down. To stop escaping into the next moment, and arrive in this one.
            Because the only place where healing and transformation can happen is here. Now. In this breath.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this small pause within the chaos, something quietly opens up. A quiet truth. A soft shift.
            The beginning of real clarity. You don’t need to fix anything or push. You just notice, gently.
            And maybe let go of a thought, a pattern, a fear, just for now. Not because you must, but because you’re ready.

            “Maybe in that stillness, you’ll remember something essential. Something that’s been waiting inside you all along.”

            If you’re ready to meet yourself, gently and honestly, this is where it starts.

          <p>
            I didn’t trust. Life had taught me that trust will only hurt you. In the end, everyone leaves.
            You get betrayed. So I told myself I could only rely on myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Underneath the strength I showed, I was scared. Mistrust had become my baseline. Some people trust everyone
            except themselves. Others only trust themselves, but not the world. For both, the root is the same:
            deep down, we don’t believe in our own emotions, our intuition, or our worth.
          </p>
          <p>
            We all came into this world with trust. Somewhere along the way, we lost it — to protect ourselves, to survive.
            We began to obey, control, judge, stay safe, avoid pain. We learned to ignore what we feel and question what we know.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trust doesn’t come all at once. It grows with each honest step you take. It’s not about certainty.
            It’s about trying one step and seeing that the world doesn’t fall apart. Quite the opposite: life comes toward you.
          </p>
          <p>
            You don’t need to trust the whole path. Just the next step. And then the next. That’s how I learned to trust again.
            First, myself. Then, life. And I’ll help you do the same.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trust isn’t the absence of fear. It’s the decision to walk, even without knowing how the path unfolds —
            believing that when you keep walking, life will meet you.

            Courage isn’t the absence of fear. It’s choosing to take a step, even when fear is still present.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a long time, I lived safely below my true potential, hidden in the comfort zone. I avoided challenges and
            chose only what felt familiar and safe. Fear of making the wrong decisions. Fear of being judged.
            I was hiding in the backseat of my life, letting fear take the wheel.
          </p>
          <p>
            It slowly drained my life force, my aliveness, and my joy. Because deep down, I knew I was playing small.
            I knew I could do better, but I didn’t know how — until I decided to get back in the driver’s seat.
          </p>
          <p>
            What does it really take? Not a heroic leap. Just the willingness to take one small step, without any guarantee.
            Not thinking about doing it, but actually doing it. As long as you’re not in motion, you’ll never know what’s possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes, courage looks like showing up with shaking hands. Saying yes to yourself when everything in you says “stay safe.”
            Or saying no to others. Walking forward without knowing where it leads, but knowing that staying stuck is no longer an option.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve learned that fear doesn’t vanish overnight. But it loses its power when you move anyway.

            <p>
              I’ve read the books. I’ve studied the methods. I sat with many amazing teachers. Each of them gave me a piece of the puzzle.
              Their words were powerful, but none of them stayed to help me put the pieces together.
            </p>
            <p>
              No one asked me what I truly needed. No one offered to walk with me while I tried to make sense of it all.
              So I had to do it myself — slowly, painfully, integrating one piece at a time into my real life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Maybe you’ve also been waiting: for a sign, a solution, or someone to finally tell you what to do.
              No one will come to knock at your door. It is up to you to start walking your path.
            </p>
            <p>
              No one can walk your path for you. And if you follow someone else’s path, it will never lead you home to yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
              You have to choose. Take the first step into the unknown. Risk being misunderstood. Risk failing.
              Risk discovering that you’re more than you ever thought possible. Risk being successful.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I was afraid, no one held my hand. When I was overwhelmed, no one whispered encouragement.
              I had to find my way alone, step by step. Letting life carry me, even when I had no idea where it would lead.
            </p>
            <p>
              That is why I know you already have what it takes for the first step. Even if it’s small. Even if you doubt.
              Every step counts. And together, they create your own unique path.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-sm md:text-base text-slate-700">
              But here’s the difference: you don’t have to walk it alone, like I did. I’m here to offer you what I once longed for —
              until you feel strong enough to walk on your own, with confidence, clarity, and a heart that trusts itself again.
