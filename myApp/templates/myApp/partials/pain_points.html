          I was tired. Not because I did too much, but because I carried too much. <span class="text-emerald-300/90">Alone.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          From looking like a strong and successful business owner on the outside while feeling lost on the inside.
          From always being the one who holds things together, caring for others more than myself. Quietly falling apart within.
        </p>
        <p>
          And still, I kept going. Not dramatic. Just steady. Day after day. Like a quiet ache you can’t explain.
        </p>
        <p>
          My life began to feel too small for the person I was becoming. Until one day, I couldn’t pretend anymore.
          Something inside whispered, “That can’t be all. There must be more than this.”
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn’t know what to do. I only knew I couldn’t keep living this way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, I felt lost. I was afraid. And confused. My beliefs collapsed like a house of cards.
          But the fear of staying stuck was greater than the fear of changing direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I started. Without a plan. Without clarity. But with a clear decision: “I have to do something different.”
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s how my path began. Not heroic. Not certain. Not brave, but because I couldn’t continue like this anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong class="block text-xl md:text-2xl lg:text-[1.6rem] leading-snug mb-2">
            I began, one uncertain step at a time.
          </strong>
          Life didn’t show me the path all at once. Just quiet signs along the way.
          I was being led. And I learned to trust. Also myself again.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you feel like you’re at a crossroads, unsure but ready, that’s exactly where my path began too.
          And maybe now is the moment to listen to that quiet voice inside you, calling for your attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve walked that path. I know what it takes to move forward, even when it feels impossible for you.

            Sustainable personal growth doesn’t happen overnight.
            In nature, strength doesn’t come from speed. It grows from depth.

            Only what grows deep roots can weather any storm. You don’t have to change your whole life in one leap.
            All it takes is a willingness to stay in motion, one step at a time.
