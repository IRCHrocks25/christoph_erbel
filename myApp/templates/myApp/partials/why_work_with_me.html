            I never planned to become a mentor. There was no business model. No big idea. Just that inner voice growing louder and louder, until I couldn't ignore it&nbsp;anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
            I began to realize that what I believed about myself, and about others, wasn't the truth. It was an illusion. My whole life had become a performance. One version of me for the outside world. Another, hidden deep inside, carrying pain I didn't even understand. Until I couldn't hold it all together&nbsp;anymore.

            So I started walking. Just one small, uncertain step. I didn't know where I was going. But I knew I couldn't go&nbsp;back.
          </p>
          <p>
            Slowly, something began to shift, inside me and around me. Not through grand visions, but through quiet moments and simple truths. I was being guided. Not by plans, but by&nbsp;presence.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the first time, I felt something new: a sense of hope. That maybe this path would lead me somewhere&nbsp;true.

            Everything I lived through, the confusing thoughts and emotions, the breakdowns, became the foundation of my own healing. Each experience became a lesson gifted to me. Each lesson became a carefully placed stone. Without realizing it, I began to build a bridge back home to&nbsp;myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            A bridge between the roles and patterns of functioning and visible superficial success, and the invisible world of healing, connection, and happiness. This is what gives my life meaning. To be that bridge for others, helping them end the cycle of silent struggle and come home to their true&nbsp;self.

            That's why today, I serve as a mentor. A guide. A bridge. Not because I've figured it all out, but because I've seen what is possible when we stop running, start listening, and begin to remember who we really are. And change the direction of life. Not by claiming to have all the answers, but because I've lived the&nbsp;questions.

            Because I know what it means to feel lost, disconnected, uncertain, even when life looks "perfect" on the outside. I became the mentor I once needed. Someone who sees the whole picture. Who walks beside you. Who doesn't let go when things get hard. Who holds your hands when you start to doubt, feel not enough, anxious, and helps you discover the strength that's already inside you, even if you don't see it yet. Someone who never loses trust in&nbsp;you.

            Today, I help people return to themselves. Not as they should be, but as they truly are. Waiting inside to unfold. Without pressure. Without pretending. Step by step. Tailored to what is possible, given the situation they live in, with all the duties and responsibilities. But always with presence, compassion, clarity, and deep trust in what's possible. For everyone. Also for&nbsp;you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because no matter where you are right now, there is a path. I'm here. I've walked the path, and I know how to guide others through their next step, no matter how&nbsp;small.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-900">
            If you're afraid you don't have the time, the strength, or the answers yet, that's okay. I've had that feeling too. But my own path showed that you don't need to change your life in one leap. All it takes is a willingness to stay in motion. One step at a&nbsp;time.
